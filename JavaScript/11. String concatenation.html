        // if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them
        let s = "my" + "string";
        alert(s); // mystring

        // Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
        // For example:
        alert( '1' + 2 ); // "12"
        alert( 2 + '1' ); // "21"

        alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"
        // Here, operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it returns 4,
        // then the next + adds the string 1 to it, so it’s like 4 + '1' = '41'.

        alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
        // Here, the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as strings too.
        // The 2 gets concatenated to '1', so it’s like '1' + 2 = "12" and "12" + 2 = "122".


        // The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way.
        // Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.
        alert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number
        alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers

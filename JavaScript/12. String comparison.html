        // Strings are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.

        /* To see whether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.
        In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter. */

        // For example:
        alert( 'Z' > 'A' ); // true
        alert( 'Glow' > 'Glee' ); // true
        alert( 'Bee' > 'Be' ); // true

        /* The algorithm to compare two strings is simple :
        1. Compare the first character of both strings.
        2. If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s,
        then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
        3. Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
        4. Repeat until the end of either string.
        5. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater. */
        
        // In the first example above, the comparison 'Z' > 'A' gets to a result at the first step.

        /* The second comparison 'Glow' and 'Glee' needs more steps as strings are compared character-by-character:
        G is the same as G.
        l is the same as l.
        o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater. */


        // Correct comparisons

        /* The call str.localeCompare(str2) returns an integer indicating whether str is less,
        equal or greater than str2 according to the language rules:

        Returns a negative number if str is less than str2.
        Returns a positive number if str is greater than str2.
        Returns 0 if they are equivalent. */

        alert("A".localeCompare("Z")); // -1
        alert("z".localeCompare("a")); // 1
        alert("A".localeCompare("A")); // 0

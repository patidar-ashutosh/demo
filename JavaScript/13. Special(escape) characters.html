        // what is Special characters(escape character)?
        // Special characters yani ki jiska use karke ham chahe to new line, tab or multiple thing add kar sakte hai.

        /*
        \n	=> add New line

        \r	=> In Windows text files a combination of two characters \r\n represents a new break,
        while on non-Windows OS it’s just \n. That’s for historical reasons, most Windows software also understands \n. 

        \', \", \` => Quotes

        \\	=> write Backslash

        \t	=> add Tab

        \b, \f, \v	=> Backspace, Form Feed, Vertical Tab – mentioned for completeness, coming from old times,
        not used nowadays (you can forget them right now). */

        // NOTE : As you can see, all special characters start with a backslash character \. It is also called an “escape character”.

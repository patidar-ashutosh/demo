        /* What is Statements ?
        Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
        a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
        We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon. */

        alert('World');

        /* What is Semicolons ?
        A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.

        ecommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines.
        This rule is widely adopted by the community.
        Let’s note once again – it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time.
        But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them. */

        /* What is Comments?
        Comments esi lines hoti hai jo ki javascript engine run nahi karta hai.
        Comments sirf developer ke understanding ke liye likhe jaate hai.

        JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable. */

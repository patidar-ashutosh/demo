        /* An array is a special kind of object. The square brackets used to access a property arr[0] actually come from the object syntax.
        That’s essentially the same as obj[key], where arr is the object, while numbers are used as keys.

        They extend objects providing special methods to work with ordered collections of data and also the length property.
        But at the core it’s still an object.

        Remember, there are only eight basic data types in JavaScript (see the Data types chapter for more info).
        Array is an object and thus behaves like an object. */

        // For instance, it is copied by reference:
        let fruits = ["Banana"];
        let copyArr = fruits; // copy by reference (two variables reference the same array)
        alert( copyArr === fruits ); // true
        copyArr.push("Pear"); // modify the array by reference
        alert( fruits ); // Banana, Pear - 2 items now

        /* …But what makes arrays really special is their internal representation. The engine tries to store its elements in the contiguous memory area,
        one after another, just as depicted on the illustrations in this chapter, and there are other optimizations as well, to make arrays work really fast.

        But they all break if we quit working with an array as with an “ordered collection” and start working with it as if it were a regular object. */

        // Another Way to copy an array (Using Spread Operator)
        let arr = [1, 2, 3];
        let arrCopy = [...arr]; // spread the array into a list of parameters
                                // then put the result into a new array

        // do the arrays have the same contents?
        alert(JSON.stringify(arr) === JSON.stringify(arrCopy)); // true

        // are the arrays equal?
        alert(arr === arrCopy); // false (not same reference)

        // modifying our initial array does not modify the copy:
        arr.push(4);
        alert(arr); // 1, 2, 3, 4
        alert(arrCopy); // 1, 2, 3

        


        /* The ways to misuse an array :
        Add a non-numeric property like arr.test = 5.
        Make holes, like: add arr[0] and then arr[1000] (and nothing between them).
        Fill the array in the reverse order, like arr[1000], arr[999] and so on. */

        /* Please think of arrays as special structures to work with the ordered data.
        They provide special methods for that. Arrays are carefully tuned inside JavaScript engines to work with contiguous ordered data,
        please use them this way. And if you need arbitrary keys, chances are high that you actually require a regular object {}. */

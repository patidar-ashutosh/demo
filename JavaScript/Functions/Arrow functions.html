        // What is Arrow functions?
        // Arrow functions hai wo sirf function ko likhne ka ek tarika hai.
        // Arrow functions is just a way to write a function

        // Jese ki hamare pass ek sum function hai
        let sum1 = function(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        };

        // ab yadi ham is sum1 function ko Arrow function me convert karenge to kuch esa hoga
        let sum2 = (a, b) => a + b;

        alert( sum2(1, 2) );

        /* Sometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements.
        In that case, we can enclose them in curly braces.
        The major difference is that curly braces require a return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does). */

        // Like this:
        let sum3 = (a, b) => {  // the curly brace opens a multiline function
            let result = a + b;
            return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit "return"
        };

        alert( sum3(1, 2) );


        // IN SHORTS
        /* Arrow functions are handy for simple actions, especially for one-liners. They come in two flavors:
        1. Without curly braces: (...args) => expression – the right side is an expression:
        the function evaluates it and returns the result. Parentheses can be omitted, if there’s only a single argument, e.g. n => n*2.

        2. With curly braces: (...args) => { body } – brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function,
        but we need an explicit return to return something. */



        // Arrow functions have no “this”
        // As we remember from the chapter Object methods, "this", arrow functions do not have this. If this is accessed, it is taken from the outside.

        // For instance, we can use it to iterate inside an object method:
        let group = {
            title: "Our Group",
            students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

            showList() {
                this.students.forEach(
                student => alert(this.title + ': ' + student)
                );
            }
        };

        group.showList();
        // Here in forEach, the arrow function is used, so this.title in it is exactly the same as in the outer method showList. That is: group.title.



        /* Summary
        Arrow functions:
        Do not have this
        Do not have arguments
        Can’t be called with new */

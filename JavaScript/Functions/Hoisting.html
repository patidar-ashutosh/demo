        // What is Hosting?
        /* It is Process to moving Function Declaration to the top of file.
        it's done automatically by JS Engine.
        
        In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions,
        variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope – all before code execution. In turn,
        this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared */

        // Hosting me kya hota hai ki koi ek function hai usme kuch variables hai to wo function ke first line pe move ho jaayenge.

        // Hosting hai wo only var type ke variables ko hee host karta hai.
        // Example
        varTypeVariable = "abc";
        alert(varTypeVariable);
        var varTypeVariable;

        // yaha pe ham varTypeVariable variable ko declaration ke pehle is liye access kar pa rahe hai,
        // kyo ki var type ke jo variable hote hai wo host ho jaate hai
        // yani ki ye code back side me kuch esa hoga
        /* var varTypeVariable;
        varTypeVariable = "abc";
        alert(varTypeVariable); */


        // Example of let variable
        letTypeVariable = "test";
        alert(letTypeVariable); // give an error
        let letTypeVariable;
        // yaha pe hame error mile ga kyo ki let type ke variable hai wo hoisted nahi hote hai
        // is liye ham variable ko declaration ke pehle access nahi kar sakte hai.



        // NOTE : Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not.
        // Example
        function sayHi() {
            alert(phrase);

            var phrase = "Hello";
        }
        sayHi(); // undefined

        /* So the code works essentially like this:
        function sayHi() {
            var phrase; // declaration works at the start...
            alert(phrase); // undefined
            phrase = "Hello"; // ...assignment - when the execution reaches it.
        }
        sayHi(); */




        // IN SHORT
        /* In JavaScript, variables, functions, classes, and imports are all hoisted, which means that their declarations
        are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed: 

        Variables: When you declare a variable using the var keyword, the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope.
        This means that you can use a variable before it has been declared, but its value will be undefined until it is assigned a value. 

        Functions: Hoisting makes function declarations possible. For example, if you declare a function and execute
        it before the line it was declared,everything works without errors. 

        Classes: Hoisting also applies to classes. 

        Imports: Hoisting also applies to imports. 

        Hoisting is a special behavior of the JavaScript interpreter. It's not a term defined in the ECMAScript specification,
        but the spec does define a group of declarations as HoistableDeclaration. */

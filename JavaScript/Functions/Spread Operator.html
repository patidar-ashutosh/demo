        // Why we need Spread Operator ?
        /* there’s a built-in function Math.max that returns the greatest number from a list:
        alert( Math.max(3, 5, 1) ); // 5
        Now let’s say we have an array [3, 5, 1]. How do we call Math.max with it?
        Passing it “as is” won’t work, because Math.max expects a list of numeric arguments, not a single array */

        // Spread syntax to the rescue! It looks similar to rest parameters, also using ..., but does quite the opposite.
        // When ...arr is used in the function call, it “expands” an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.

        // For Math.max:
        let arr = [3, 5, 1];
        alert( Math.max(...arr) ); // 5 (spread turns array into a list of arguments)


        // We also can pass multiple iterables this way:
        let arr1 = [1, -2, 3, 4];
        let arr2 = [8, 3, -8, 1];
        alert( Math.max(...arr1, ...arr2) ); // 8


        // We can even combine the spread syntax with normal values:
        let array1 = [1, -2, 3, 4];
        let array2 = [8, 3, -8, 1];
        alert( Math.max(1, ...array1, 2, ...array2, 25) ); // 25


        // the spread syntax can be used to merge arrays
        // arrays ko combine karne ka ek or bhi way hai jo ki hai : spread operator
        // EXample
        let first = [1,2,5,3,6];
        let second = [4,7,2];
        // let result = [... first , ... second];
        console.log(result);
        // ham chahe to bich me kuch letter bhi add kar sakte hai
        let result = [... first , true , 'new', ... second, 'x', 'y' , 9];
        console.log(result);


        // For instance, here we use the spread syntax to turn the string into array of characters
        let str = "Hello";
        alert( [...str] ); // H,e,l,l,o
        // The spread syntax internally uses iterators to gather elements, the same way as for..of does.
        // So, for a string, for..of returns characters and ...str becomes "H","e","l","l","o". The list of characters is passed to array initializer [...str].

    <!-- Difference Between Spread And Rest Operator

    When we see "..." in the code, it is either rest parameters or the spread syntax.

    There’s an easy way to distinguish between them:
    -> When ... is at the end of function parameters, it’s “rest parameters” and gathers the rest of the list of arguments into an array.
    -> When ... occurs in a function call or alike, it’s called a “spread syntax” and expands an array into a list.

    Use patterns:
    -> Rest parameters are used to create functions that accept any number of arguments.
    -> The spread syntax is used to pass an array to functions that normally require a list of many arguments.
    
    Together they help to travel between a list and an array of parameters with ease. -->

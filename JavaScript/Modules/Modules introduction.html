    <!-- As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called “modules”.

    A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose. -->


    <!-- What is a module?
    A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

    Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

    -> export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
    -> import allows the import of functionality from other modules. -->

    <!-- As modules support special keywords and features, we must tell the browser that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute <script type="module"> -->

    <script type="module">
        import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';
        
        document.body.innerHTML = sayHi('Duo');
    </script>

        

    <!-- Core module features -->

    <!-- 1. Always “use strict” -->
    <!-- Modules always work in strict mode. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable will give an error. -->
    <script type="module">
        // a = 5; // error
    </script>


    <!-- 2. Module-level scope -->
    <!-- Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.

    In the example below, two scripts are imported, and hello.js tries to use user variable declared in user.js. It fails, because it’s a separate module (you’ll see the error in the console): -->
    <script type="module" src="user.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>

    
    <!-- In the browser, if we talk about HTML pages, independent top-level scope also exists for each <script type="module">. -->

    <!-- Here are two scripts on the same page, both type="module". They don’t see each other’s top-level variables: -->    
    <script type="module">
        // The variable is only visible in this module script
        let user = "John";
    </script>
    
    <script type="module">
        alert(user); // Error: user is not defined
    </script>
    


    <!-- A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported -->
     
    <!-- If the same module is imported into multiple other modules, its code is executed only once, upon the first import. Then its exports are given to all further importers. -->
    <script>
        // First, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times will trigger it only once – the first time:

        // 📁 alert.js
        alert("Module is evaluated!");

        // Import the same module from different files
        // 📁 1.js
        // import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!

        // 📁 2.js
        // import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)
    </script>


    
    <script>
        // Now, let’s consider a deeper example.
        // Let’s say, a module exports an object:

        // 📁 admin.js
        export let admin = {
            name: "John"
        };
    
        // If this module is imported from multiple files, the module is only evaluated the first time, admin object is created, and then passed to all further importers.

        // All importers get exactly the one and only admin object:
        // 📁 1.js
        import {admin} from './admin.js';
        admin.name = "Pete";

        // 📁 2.js
        import {admin} from './admin.js';
        alert(admin.name); // Pete

        // Both 1.js and 2.js reference the same admin object
        // Changes made in 1.js are visible in 2.js

        // As you can see, when 1.js changes the name property in the imported admin, then 2.js can see the new admin.name.

        // That’s exactly because the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are shared between importers, so if something changes the admin object, other importers will see that.
    </script>




    <!-- import.meta
    The object import.meta contains the information about the current module.

    Its content depends on the environment. In the browser, it contains the URL of the script, or a current webpage URL if inside HTML: -->
    <script type="module">
       alert(import.meta.url); // script URL
        // for an inline script - the URL of the current HTML-page
    </script>



    <!-- In a module, “this” is undefined
    In a module, top-level this is undefined.

    Compare it to non-module scripts, where this is a global object: -->    
    <script>
        alert(this); // window
    </script>
    
    <script type="module">
        alert(this); // undefined
    </script>
    


    <!-- Browser-specific features -->
    <!-- Module scripts are deferred
    As a side effect, module scripts always “see” the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them. -->

    <!-- For instance: -->    
    <script type="module">
      alert(typeof button); // object: the script can 'see' the button below
      // as modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded
    </script>
    
    <!-- Compare to regular script below: -->
    <script>
      alert(typeof button); // button is undefined, the script can't see elements below
      // regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed
    </script>
    
    <button id="button">Button</button>


    <!-- Async works on inline scripts -->
    <!-- For non-module scripts, the async attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document. -->

    <!-- For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well. -->

    <!-- That’s good for functionality that doesn’t depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level event listeners. -->

    <!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
    <!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
    <script async type="module">
        import {counter} from './analytics.js';

        counter.count();
    </script>





    <!-- External scripts -->
    <!-- External scripts that have type="module" are different in two aspects: -->

    <!-- 1. External scripts with the same src run only once: -->
    <!-- Example -->
    <!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
    <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>


    <!-- if a module script is fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header Access-Control-Allow-Origin allowing the fetch. -->
    <!-- Example -->
    <!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->
    <!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->
    <script type="module" src="http://another-site.com/their.js"></script>

    <!-- That ensures better security by default. -->




    <!-- No “bare” modules allowed

    In the browser, import must get either a relative or absolute URL. Modules without any path are called “bare” modules. Such modules are not allowed in import. -->

    <!-- For instance, this import is invalid: -->
    <script>
        import {sayHi} from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module
        // the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is
    </script>
    
    <!-- Certain environments, like Node.js or bundle tools allow bare modules, without any path, as they have their own ways for finding modules and hooks to fine-tune them. But browsers do not support bare modules yet. -->

        // what is this keyword?
        // this keyword hai wo current object ko reffer ya kahe ki point karta hai. 
        // this keyword is use for point to current object
        "use strict";


        // “this” in methods
        // It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
        // To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
        // The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.
        // Example
        let user = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,

            sayHi() {
                // "this" is the "current object"
                alert(this.name);
            }
        };
        user.sayHi(); // John
        // Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.



        // “this” is not bound
        // In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages.
        // It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.

        // There’s no syntax error in the following example:
        function sayHi() {
            // alert( this.name );
            alert( this );
        }
        sayHi();
        // The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.
        // yani jab ham kisi normal function me this keyword ka use karenge to wo global object window ko point karenga

        /* In this case this is undefined in strict mode.
        If we try to access this.name, there will be an error.

        In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser,
        we’ll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes. */

    <!-- What is callback-based” style of asynchronous programming ?
    A function that does something asynchronously should provide a callback argument where we put the function to run after it’s complete. -->

    <!-- Example -->
    <script>
        // add a callback function as a second argument to loadScript that should execute when the script loads:
        function loadScript(src, callback) {
            let script = document.createElement('script');
            script.src = src;

            script.onload = () => callback(script);
            // The onload event is basically executes a function after the script is loaded and executed.

            document.head.append(script);
        }

        // call new functions from the script, we should write that in the callback:

        loadScript('/my/script.js', function() {
            // the callback runs after the script is loaded
            alert("Callback is called : script.js is done"); // so now it works
        });

        // That’s the idea: the second argument is a function (usually anonymous) that runs when the action is completed.
    </script>


    <!-- Real Script Example -->
    <!-- Here’s a runnable example with a real script: -->
    <script>
        function loadScript(src, callback) {
            let script = document.createElement('script');
            script.src = src;
            script.onload = () => callback(script);
            document.head.append(script);
        }

        loadScript('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/3.2.0/lodash.js', script => {
            alert(`Cool, the script ${script.src} is loaded`);
            alert( _ ); // _ is a function declared in the loaded script
        });
    </script>



    <!-- Callback in callback -->
    <script>
        function loadScript(src, callback) {
            let script = document.createElement('script');
            script.src = src;

            script.onload = () => callback(script);
            // The onload event is basically executes a function after the script is loaded and executed.

            document.head.append(script);
        }
        
        // How can we load two scripts sequentially: the first one, and then the second one after it?

        // The natural solution would be to put the second loadScript call inside the callback, like this:
        loadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {
            alert(`Cool, the ${script.src} is loaded, let's load one more`);

            loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {
                alert(`Cool, the second script is loaded`);
            });
        });

        // After the outer loadScript is complete, the callback initiates the inner one.

        // What if we want one more script…?
        loadScript('/my/script.js', function(script) {

            loadScript('/my/script2.js', function(script) {

                loadScript('/my/script3.js', function(script) {
                    // ...continue after all scripts are loaded
                });
            });
        });

        // So, every new action is inside a callback. That’s fine for few actions, but not good for many, so we’ll see other variants soon.
    </script>




    <!-- Pyramid of Doom -->
    <script>
        // multiple asynchronous actions that follow one after another, we’ll have code like this:

        loadScript('1.js', function(error, script) {
            if (error) {
                handleError(error);
            } else {
                // ...
                loadScript('2.js', function(error, script) {
                    if (error) {
                        handleError(error);
                    } else {
                        // ...
                        loadScript('3.js', function(error, script) {
                        if (error) {
                            handleError(error);
                        } else {
                            // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)
                        }
                        });
                    }
                });
            }
        });

        /* In the code above:
        We load 1.js, then if there’s no error…
        We load 2.js, then if there’s no error…
        We load 3.js, then if there’s no error – do something else (*). */

        /* As calls become more nested, the code becomes deeper and increasingly more difficult to manage, especially if we have real code instead of ... that may include more loops, conditional statements and so on.

        That’s sometimes called “callback hell” or “pyramid of doom.” */

        // The “pyramid” of nested calls grows to the right with every asynchronous action. Soon it spirals out of control.

        // So this way of coding isn’t very good.
    </script>


    <!-- Better way to Write Above code -->
    <script>
        // We can try to alleviate the problem by making every action a standalone function, like this:

        loadScript('1.js', step1);

        function step1(error, script) {
            if (error) {
                handleError(error);
            } else {
                // ...
                loadScript('2.js', step2);
            }
        }

        function step2(error, script) {
            if (error) {
                handleError(error);
            } else {
                // ...
                loadScript('3.js', step3);
            }
        }

        function step3(error, script) {
            if (error) {
                handleError(error);
            } else {
                // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)
            }
        }
    </script>

    <!-- See? It does the same thing, and there’s no deep nesting now because we made every action a separate top-level function.

    It works, but the code looks like a torn apart spreadsheet. It’s difficult to read, and you probably noticed that one needs to eye-jump between pieces while reading it. That’s inconvenient, especially if the reader is not familiar with the code and doesn’t know where to eye-jump.

    Also, the functions named step* are all of single use, they are created only to avoid the “pyramid of doom.” No one is going to reuse them outside of the action chain. So there’s a bit of namespace cluttering here.

    We’d like to have something better.

    Luckily, there are other ways to avoid such pyramids. One of the best ways is to use “promises” -->
